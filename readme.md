`pycinema` is a toolkit of python-based components for creating, filtering, transforming and viewing Cinema databases. Cinema databases are a compact and interactive output format that can be created from scientific visualization tools and infrastructures (ParaView, Ascent, etc.) or created through other code by writing to the common output format. There is more information about the Cinema project [here](https://cinemascience.github.io).

Full documentation for this project can be found on [readthedocs.org](https://pycinema.readthedocs.org)

## New concepts to Cinema: 'filter graphs' and 'workspaces'

This toolkit introduces the concept of *filter graphs* and *workspaces* to Cinema. Data operations (loading, querying, manipulating and viewing) are performed by *filters* that take input data, transform it, and pass it on in the form of tables, data, or data products. A collection of these *filters* is connected in a *filter graph*, and a *filter graph* can be saved in a reusable way known as a *workspace*. This makes the cinema toolkit a flexible platform for creating, modifying and saving data workflows.

# Working with the code and the `pycinema` module

- Installing and running with the pycinema repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:cinemascience/pycinema.git
cd pycinema
python3 -m venv pcenv
source pcenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install . 
```

- Installing and running with the released pycinema module

```
mkdir pyc-test
cd pyc-test
python3 -m venv pcenv
source pcenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pycinema 
```

- Running examples

You can now use this python environment to run examples from the repository. Run `cinema` and select a file from the `data` directory:

```
source pcenv/bin/activate
cinema view data/sphere.cdb
```

# Making and uploading the python module

```
make module
``` 

And then to upload it to `pypi` (assuming you have permission):

```
make module-upload
```

To upload it to `testpypi` (assuming you have permission):

```
make module-test-upload
```
