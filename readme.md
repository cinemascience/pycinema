# Cinema Engine
![smoke](https://github.com/cinemascience/pycinema/actions/workflows/RenderTest.yml/badge.svg)

Cinema v2.0 is a newly designed toolkit of python-based components for creating, filtering, transforming and viewing Cinema databases. There is more information about the Cinema project [here](https://cinemascience.github.io).

Cinema databases are a compact and interactive output format that can be created from scientific visualization tools and infrastructures (ParaView, Ascent, etc.) or created through other code by writing to the common output format.

# Working with the code and the `pycinema` module

## Installing and running with the pycinema module

```
python3 -m venv pcenv
source pcenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install . 
pip install jupyterlab 
```

## Installing and running with the test pycinema module

```
python3 -m venv pcenv
source pcenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index https://pypi.org/simple pycinema
pip install jupyterlab
```

# Creating a local python environment

To create a local python environment for this project, run the following commands within the repository directory:
```
python3 -m venv pcenv
source pcenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyterlab
pip install .
```

# Running examples

You can now use this python environment to run examples from the repository. Run `jupyter-lab` and select a file from the `examples` directory:

```
source pcenv/bin/activate
jupyter-lab
```

# Making and uploading the python module

```
make module
``` 

And then to upload it to `pypi` (assuming you have permission):

```
make module-upload
```

To upload it to `testpypi` (assuming you have permission):

```
make module-test-upload
```
